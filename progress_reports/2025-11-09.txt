Learnt about Docker Networks and their types -
*1. Default Bridge Network*

   -

   Docker’s built-in bridge network.
   -

   Containers on this network can communicate using IP addresses, but
   container name resolution is limited.
   *Create Command:* (No command required as this is created by default)
   Network name: bridge

------------------------------
*2. User-Defined Custom Bridge Network*

   -

   A custom bridge network created by the user for better
   container-to-container communication and isolation.
   -

   It supports automatic DNS-based container name resolution and provides
   improved network control.
   *Create Command:*

docker network create --driver bridge my-custom-bridge

------------------------------
*3. Host Network*

   -

   The container shares the host machine’s network directly.
   -

   It uses the host’s IP and ports, resulting in no network isolation
   between the host and the container.
   *Create Command:*

docker network create --driver host my-host-net

------------------------------
*4. None Network*

   -

   Disables all networking for the container.
   -

   The container has no internal or external network access.
   *Create Command:*

docker network create --driver none my-none-net
