🧩 What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a tool that helps me run and manage multi-container
Docker applications easily.
Instead of starting each container manually with long 'docker run'
commands, I can define everything
(services, networks, volumes) inside a single 'docker-compose.yml' file.
Then I can spin up the entire
application stack with a single command.

-----------------------------------------
⚙️ Why do I use Docker Compose?

- Makes it simple to run multiple containers together (like a web app and a
database)
- Keeps environments consistent across development, testing, and production
- Supports environment variables, custom networks, and volumes
- Saves time by managing the entire stack from one YAML file

-----------------------------------------
🧾 Common Commands

docker compose up          → Builds (if needed) and starts all services
docker compose down        → Stops and removes containers, networks, and
volumes
docker compose build       → Builds or rebuilds the service images
docker compose ps          → Lists running containers
docker compose logs        → Displays logs from all running services
docker compose exec <service> <command>  → Runs a command inside a running
service

(Note: In older versions, 'docker-compose' with a hyphen was used.)

-----------------------------------------
📘 Example docker-compose.yml

version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html

  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  db_data:

-----------------------------------------
🧠 How it Works

- 'web' runs an Nginx container serving local HTML files on port 8080.
- 'db' runs a MySQL container with persistent storage and environment
variables.
- Both containers automatically connect over the same network created by
Docker Compose.

To start everything:
    docker compose up -d

To stop and clean up:
    docker compose down

-----------------------------------------
🌍 Real-World Use Cases

- Local development (e.g., Node.js app + MongoDB or Flask app + Redis)
- CI/CD testing environments to mimic production
- Running multiple microservices locally
- Learning how containers communicate and use volumes

-----------------------------------------
✅ Summary

Docker Compose = One YAML file to define, run, and manage multi-container
applications.
It’s a must-have tool for any DevOps or cloud environment setup.
