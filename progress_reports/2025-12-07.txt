        ☸️ Kubernetes
=========================================

Today I started learning Kubernetes, its architecture, and how to create a
local Kubernetes cluster using **KIND** and **Minikube**.

This marks the beginning of working with container orchestration!


=========================================
1. 🏗️ Kubernetes Architecture – What I Learned
=========================================

Kubernetes is built on a **Master–Worker** (Control Plane + Nodes)
architecture.

Main components:

-----------------------------------------
🔹 Control Plane (Master)
-----------------------------------------
1. API Server
   - The main entry point to Kubernetes
   - All kubectl requests go here

2. Controller Manager
   - Ensures the cluster is in the desired state
   - Handles scaling, rollout, node monitoring

3. Scheduler
   - Decides which pod runs on which node

4. etcd
   - The distributed key-value store
   - Stores cluster state and configuration


-----------------------------------------
🔹 Worker Nodes
-----------------------------------------
1. Kubelet
   - Talks to the API Server
   - Ensures containers are running

2. Kube Proxy
   - Manages networking, routing, service communication

3. Container Runtime
   - Runs containers (Docker, containerd, CRI-O, etc.)

All these work together to keep the cluster running reliably.


=========================================
2. 🧪 Creating Local Kubernetes Clusters
=========================================

Today I learned two tools for creating local Kubernetes clusters:


=========================================
   🐳 KIND (Kubernetes IN Docker)
=========================================

- Creates Kubernetes clusters using Docker containers
- Lightweight and fast
- Good for testing, CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions
- Cluster runs entirely inside Docker

Basic command:

kind create cluster --name dev-cluster

This creates:
- Control plane as a Docker container
- Worker nodes as Docker containers


=========================================
   🎡 Minikube
=========================================

- A single-node Kubernetes cluster for local development
- Uses a VM or Docker driver
- Great for learning Kubernetes resources (pods, services, deployments)

Start a cluster:

minikube start

Check status:

minikube status

Minikube also provides:
- Built-in dashboard
- Add-ons (ingress, metrics-server, registry)


=========================================
3. 🌍 Real-World Usage of KIND & Minikube
=========================================

These tools are used for:

- Learning Kubernetes architecture
- Testing deployments locally before production
- Practicing YAML manifests (pods, services, deployments)
- Building CI/CD pipelines with Kubernetes integration
- Trying out new Kubernetes tools, operators, controllers


=========================================
4. 🚀 What I Achieved Today
=========================================

✔ Understood Kubernetes architecture
✔ Learned Control Plane vs Worker Nodes
✔ Installed and created clusters with KIND
✔ Installed and created clusters with Minikube
✔ Learned when to use which tool
✔ Took the first solid step into Kubernetes


=========================================
✅ Summary
=========================================

Kubernetes helps manage containers at scale.
Today I learned its architecture and created clusters using:

- KIND → lightweight, Docker-based cluster
- Minikube → full local Kubernetes environment

A strong start into the Kubernetes ecosystem! ⚡☸️
