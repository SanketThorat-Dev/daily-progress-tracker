Not much progress today but started with the basics of Docker Networking
Also came across few docker commands like -
1) docker attach -> to connect local terminal's std input, output etc with running Docker container's primary process
2) docker -it -> to create an interactive terminal session within a Docker container
3) docker stop -> to stop one/more containers
4) docker -itd -> to run a container in the background
5) docker exec -> to execute a command in a running container
6) docker logs -> to fetch logs of a container
