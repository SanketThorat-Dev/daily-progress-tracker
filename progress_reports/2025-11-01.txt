Today I created a small project using Docker and Java
Project: Java Docker App – Print Current Date

This is a simple Java application containerized using Docker. The goal of
this project was to understand how to package and run a basic Java program
inside a Docker container.

What This Project Does:
- A Java application (Main.java) that prints a greeting message along with
the current system date and time.
- The application is compiled and executed inside a Docker container using
an OpenJDK base image.

Tech Stack:
- Java 17: Application code
- Docker: Containerization
- OpenJDK Alpine: Lightweight base image

Project Structure:
.
├─ Dockerfile
└─ src
   └─ Main.java

How It Works:
1. Created a Dockerfile using a lightweight OpenJDK 17 Alpine base image.
2. Copied the Java source file into the container and compiled it inside
the image.
3. Built the Docker image using:
   docker build -t java-app .
4. Ran the container to execute the program:
   docker run java-app
5. The container prints:
   Hello, Docker! Current date: <current-date-time>

Outcome:
This project helped me learn:
- How to containerize a Java application
- Writing and structuring a Dockerfile
- Building and running Docker images and containers on an AWS EC2 instance
